TODO:
	* FFmpeg might not terminate correctly when the bot leaves during a song
	* Need to stream instead of downloading
	* Need to implement queueing
	* Need to automatically queue up playlists
	* Pause, resume and stop commands
	* Skip command, list command
	* Automatically leave the channel after a cooldown or when everyone leaves
	* Automatically join when someone uses !play
	* Cant add to queue until first song finishes downloading
	* Need to put songs in their own folder (or just figure out streaming)
If I were smart maybe this would be in GitHub issues
