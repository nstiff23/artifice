TODO:
	* FFmpeg might not terminate correctly when the bot leaves during a song
	* Need to stream instead of downloading
	* Need to automatically queue up playlists
	* Automatically leave the channel after a cooldown or when everyone leaves
	* Need to put songs in their own folder (or just figure out streaming)
If I were smart maybe this would be in GitHub issues
